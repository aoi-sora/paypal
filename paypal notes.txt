Third-Party Shopping Carts – The
Cart Upload Command

Third-party shopping carts integrate PayPal Payments Standard on behalf of PayPal
merchants. Third-party carts use the Cart Upload command to pass the contents of shopping
carts to PayPal for checkout and payment processing.
NOTE: If you are not a shopping cart developer, you can add a PayPal Shopping Cart to your
site that is hosted by PayPal.
Read the following topics to learn more about third-party shopping carts:
 “The Checkout Experience With the Cart Upload Command” on page 317
 “Implementing the Cart Upload Command” on page 322

Securing Your PayPal Payments
Standard Buttons
page 337

Unprotected and non-encrypted buttons that are not saved in your PayPal account are in plain
text in the source view of your webpages. The HTML button code for your payment buttons
can be viewed by anyone. A malicious third party could copy a page, change button HTML
variables such as price, and make fraudulent payments.
IMPORTANT: Merchants with significant payment volume are required to take precautions
on securing PayPal Payment Standard buttons.
PayPal provides the following strategies for securing PayPal Payments Standard buttons. Use
one or more of the following security strategies to prevent and/or detect tampering with your
buttons:

How Protected Payment Buttons Help Prevent Fraudulent Payments
Protected payment buttons help secure your payments because the HTML button code that
PayPal generates and that you paste onto your webpages is encrypted. HTML button code that
is protected with encryption cannot be altered by malicious third parties to create fraudulent
payments.
You can protect the HTML button code that PayPal generates for any kind of payment button:
 Buy Now buttons
 Add to Cart buttons
 Buy Gift Certificate buttons
 Subscribe buttons
 Automatic Billing buttons
Installment Plan buttons
Donate buttons
NOTE: PayPal cannot protect HTML button code for Add to Cart buttons with JavaScript
disabled in your browser. In such cases, use an alternative strategy to secure your
buttons. See “Reconciling Payments Manually Through Transaction History” on
page 341, and “Reconciling Payments Through Instant Payment Notification” on
page 342.

Testing Payment Buttons in the
PayPal Sandbox page 405
The PayPal Sandbox can be used to test the following functionality:
 Buy Now buttons – Test single-item payments.
For more information, see Chapter 1, “Single-Item Payments – Buy Now Buttons.”
 Subscribe buttons – Test recurring payments.
For more information, see Chapter 3, “Recurring Payments – Subscribe Buttons.”
 Donate buttons – Test contribution payments.
For more information, see Chapter 2, “Contribution Payments – Donate Buttons.”
 Shopping Cart buttons – Test multiple-item payments in a single purchase transaction.
For more information, see Chapter 6, “The PayPal Shopping Cart – Add to Cart and View
Cart Buttons.”
 Refunds – Test the refunding of money paid by PayPal members.
For more information, see Chapter 11, “Issuing Refunds.”
 Payment Data Transfer – Test your identity token, return URL, and Payment Data
Transfer settings.
To learn more, see the Payment Data Transfer page on Developer Central.
 Instant Payment Notification – Test Instant Payment Notification messages for payments
and reversals.
Instant Payment Notification messages in the Sandbox environment include the special
ipn_test variable, set to the value 1. This variable lets your code differentiate between
Instant Payment Notification messages in the Sandbox and Instant Payment Notification
messages from the live PayPal website. Use the ipn_test variable to develop scripts that
work in both situations.
IMPORTANT: Instant Payment Notification messages that come from the Sandbox cannot
be verified against the live PayPal website, and Instant Payment
Notification messages that come from the live PayPal website cannot be
verified against the Sandbox.
For more information about implementing Instant Payment Notification, see the Instant
Payment Notification Guide.
 Simulated transactions – Test scenarios, such as successful and failed eChecks.
To test in the Sandbox, create a Developer Central account. Then create multiple PayPal
test accounts for buyers and merchants so that you can simulate different scenarios.
IMPORTANT: The Sandbox does not process real money.
For more information, see the Sandbox User Guide.
